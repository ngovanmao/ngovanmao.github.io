You probably heard about IoT and Cloud computing as the technology trending in recent years. So what's next?
There are many different interesting for the emerging technology:
* Artificial Intelligence.
* Robot.
* _Fog computing_.

Even I list them as separated technology, today the technologies seem to converge into common products. For example, the robots need AI to control their activities, and behave in smart way. In addition, robots also require ubiquitous connection and computation. We know that the robots today have powerful computation to do vision, sensing locally. But what if the computation can be offloaded to the cloud, the price of robot will be reduced and the cooperation between many robots in the same areas can boost the knowledge of each robots based on the combination of powerful of Cloud computing and a lot collected sensors data (video, ladar, gps, temperature, etc.). We can see that Cloud computing is very good for robots applications. 
However, the cloud cannot provide a <mark>time-critical</mark> results when using for robots, the robots requires very fast response from environment. We don't want a robot capture a dangerous video and offload it to the cloud and wait for a few second to respond to the situation.
