# Research Projects

1. **Soldier Body Area Networks**: (Research Assistant at SUTD)
* Develop dynamic resource management schemes for SBAN system.
* Develop interference model and interference management techniques for coexistence of single SBAN, multiple SBANs, and SBANs with other networks.
* Develop an energy-efficient MAC protocol in SBAN communication platform, incorporating dynamic resource management and interference management techniques.
* Propose context-aware scheduling for SBAN to improve energy efficiency and priority of emergency messages.
* Investigate the network integration of heterogeneous wireless networking technologies to support seamless roaming and end-to-end QoS.
* Investigate the effect of operating frequency band on the proposed techniques.

# Industrial Projects
1. **IPv6 for APZ system** (R&D Engineer at DEK Vietnam):
* Description: APZ support various types of IP stack implementations for different purposes. There is an IP stack on the Central Processor for system internal communication to IO system for communicating to the Operation Support System (OSS). 
This project is to implement the IPv6 feature for APZ system as one of the network layer protocol (layer 3) on AXE platform to fully comply with all features from IPv4 connectivity. 
* Improved skills/knowledge: TCP/IP knowledge, networking program, C/C++.

2. **APZ's CP Design** (R&D Engineer at DEK Vietnam):
- Design Central Processor (CP) software block in APZ in AXE telephone exchange system. (AXE based equipment are being used as BSC/TRC, MSC, HLR, SCP, FNR, TSC, STP and wireline nodes.)
- Writing in PLEX-C language and ASA-C.
